Hello, hope you are doing well!

I have gone through your job posting and requirement skills.
Being an EXPERT WEBGL DEVELOPER, with strong command in ✔️WebGL ✔️Three.js, ✔️Typescript in short, I'm good at building interactive 3d websites using WebGL libraries such as three.js and babylon.js. I specialize in dynamic geometry, mesh-based materials, realistic shader materials using GLSL, proper lighting effects and glsl shaders, and I enjoy animating models, meshes and materials.

Attaching my working portfolio for reference:
-https://wonderland.studio/
Here, landing pages were developed using techniques such as lighting/flower effects, camera animations, and user-interactive dynamic geometry.
And working with team members, including designers and front-end/back-end developers, gave me invaluable team collaboration experience.
Three.js and GSAP were used.

This is a Car Visualization project, where the user interactively changes the textures of several parts.
React + Three.js  


Let me know your availability, so we could schedule a call for a detailed discussion and planning regarding how to bring your vision into reality, as I am a Master of it!
Best wishes!



Understanding the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how they are used to create interactive 3D experiences, use the Three.js library to create 3D objects, scenes, and animations, having a good understanding  of the different types of materials, textures, and lighting available, 
Also very familiar with the different types of cameras available in Three.js and how they can be used to create interesting perspectives in a scene or animation.
Knowing how to optimize Three.js code for performance and scalability, and  to debug and troubleshoot issues with code.
