Hello,
I see you need an expert 3d animator who will join your team and crate a 3d animated video for your co-operation.
This is similar to an excellent project I did for Ape gorilla club https://bit.ly/3qOSGdk. I have 8 years of experience and completed over 150 3d animation projects.
I know the mistakes artists make, but with extra explanations I will deliver your work perfectly, in time, and partake in the success of your project.
Time is expensive, and you do not want to risk working with someone who will not be willing to go the extra mile to ensure you are satisfied.
Watch how my past clients express happiness after working with me https://youtu.be/i62jLocb7VM.

Let's get on a call now to discuss further and know if we are the right fit for each other
Cheers!
