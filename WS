I have gone through your job posting and requirement skills.
Being an EXPERT WEBGL DEVELOPER, with strong command in ✔️Three.js, ✔️Typescript, ✔️MERN STACK in short, I'm good at building interactive 3d websites using WebGL libraries such as three.js and babylon.js. I specialize in dynamic geometry, mesh-based materials, realistic shader materials using GLSL, proper lighting effects and glsl shaders, and I enjoy animating models, meshes and materials.
